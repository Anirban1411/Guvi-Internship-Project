# Air Quality Data Analyzer üå¨Ô∏è

This project provides a Python script for performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Air Quality UCI dataset. The script automates the process of data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

---

## üìñ Description

The primary goal of this project is to offer a reusable and efficient tool for an initial analysis of a CSV file. The script reads the `AirQualityUCI.csv` data, preprocesses it by handling missing values and incorrect data types, and then generates key statistical summaries and visualizations.

This serves as a foundational step in any data science workflow, providing crucial insights into the dataset's structure and quality.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## ‚ú® Features

* **Custom Data Loading:** Reads CSV files with specified delimiters (`;`) and handles custom missing value notations (`-200`).
* **Data Cleaning:** Automatically drops irrelevant columns and fills missing numerical data with the column's mean.
* **Data Profiling:** Displays total rows, columns, and data types for a quick overview.
* **Statistical Summary:** Calculates and prints descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.) for all numerical features.
* **Visualization:**
    * Generates a **heatmap** to show the distribution of missing values before cleaning.
    * Creates a **bar chart** to visualize the mean values of each numerical column.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this script on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Anirban1411/Guvi-Internship-Project.git](https://github.com/Anirban1411/Guvi-Internship-Project.git)
    cd Guvi-Internship-Project
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run

1.  **Download the Dataset:**
    Make sure you have the `AirQualityUCI.csv` file. You can download it from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality).

2.  **Update File Path:**
    Open the Python script and update the `file_path` variable to the location of your `AirQualityUCI.csv` file.
    ```python
    # Example usage
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        file_path = 'path/to/your/AirQualityUCI.csv'  # <-- UPDATE THIS LINE
        csv_file_analyzer(file_path)
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the script from your terminal.
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## üìà Expected Output

After running the script, you will see:
1.  **Console Output:** A detailed analysis printed directly to your terminal, including the data shape, data types, missing value counts, and summary statistics.
2.  **Two Plot Windows:**
    * A heatmap showing the initial state of missing values.
    * A bar chart comparing the mean of each numerical feature.

## üìä Data Description

This project uses the **Air Quality Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device.

The script specifically analyzes columns related to gas concentrations, such as:
* `CO(GT)`: True hourly averaged concentration of CO in mg/m^3
* `PT08.S1(CO)`: PT08.S1 (tin oxide) hourly averaged sensor response
* `C6H6(GT)`: True hourly averaged Benzene concentration in ¬µg/m^3
* `PT08.S2(NMHC)`: PT08.S2 (titania) hourly averaged sensor response
* ...and other sensor readings.
